# Welcome!


Hello awesome human being(or..alien?) and thank you for taking the time to view my repos!
As you can see, most of my projects are coming from my classes here at SAIT.
Thatâ€™s because I am still a student and I am learning lots of things! I am loving this course so far and there are so many things I want to learn. I will be coming back to clean up my code after this program and see what else I can do to make my projects better.


###### Breakdown of my projects 

This is the Javascript module. Javascript is definitely more challenging than my former classes but I love how much freedom I get with it. I can do so much and it really brings my webpages to life.

###### What I've used in this module
```
* Vanilla Javascript
* Manipulating the DOM
* Window Object, Location Object, Navigator Object
* If/Else if Statements
* Loops
* Functions
* Animations
* jQuery
```
###### But wait, there's more!
```
* Ajax
* Creating Json objects
* Working with APIs
* Fetching data 
* Regular Expressions
* Local Storage (Setting, getting, and removing data)
```
### How I solved conflicts and challenges
Google is my bestfriend along with the console.
If Google can't solve my problems, I turn to my awesome colleagues!
I usually log things out first on my console when something isn't working. Stepping away from my monitor helps too and taking a quick walk helps clear my mind.



### In conclusion

My favorite part of this module was being able to create actions and animations to my design. I see my design moving and interacting with my actions and that's amazing. I also enjoyed learning jQuery and how it made my code look cleaner and even now, I am using jQuery! I go back to using Vanilla JS for things that are a bit more complicated where I have to break things down first to understand what is going on.
